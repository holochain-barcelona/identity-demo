** Replacing a Key on one of your devices **

If you need to stop one of your devices being able to interact with Holochain you can "Replace" the key in DeepKey which will effectively "Revoke" the key on the device and it will no longer work.

Replacing a key updates the key entry in DeepKey with a new one so that the device will no longer have a useable key until the new key is re-derived on that device.

Cannot delete Revocation Key only replace.
Cannot delete Authorizer key Key only replace.
